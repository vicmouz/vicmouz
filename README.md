### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Victor Mouzinho
#### I am FullStack Developer in Trinity SoluÃ§Ãµes at Recife, PE, Brazil
Since my beginning in the professional field as a Computer Network Technician I have been looking for something, my improvement, be it on a technical level (my skills) or on a personal level (relationship with people in the work environment).
People I have worked with tend to say that I am a helpful person and that I always try to help others to the maximum, so I am always looking for new things to learn, thus avoiding being stuck in the same tool or stuck to the same concepts.
Facing challenges is always good, a person who feels challenged tends to overcome obstacles in a simpler and more natural way. The obstacles I had yesterday will never be today's, and today's will never be tomorrow's
